only for shits, giggles, and devs

see main.js for main code... run in nodejs, you may need to import node fetch

in inspect element, look for requests to `https://content-developerprofiles-pa.googleapis.com/v1/profiles/idk/paths/${parsedUrl}?locale&updateMask=path.state`, copy the request, and then replace as much as possible from the main.js fetch as possible with YOUR fetch details, instances of DATAREPLACE should help but just remember to also change the profile path
